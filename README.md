# LazyCountedIterator

lazy_counted_iterator - implementation of P2406R3 proposal

Mainly done to validate the wording as appears in the proposal are correct and implementable.
The implementation is not intended to be used in production code.

Part of the implementation is based on the implementation done over Microsoft STL (https://github.com/YehezkelShB/STL)
and as such based on counted_iterator and take_view code from there.
